I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Albert Gu](https://albert-gu.github.io/). I am interested in developing *efficient and theoretically-grounded* state space models (SSMs) along with their applications across domains. 

Previously, I have worked on efficient Text-to-Speech models at  [Cartesia AI](https://cartesia.ai/), developed content safety classifiers at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/), and contributed to Google Assistant's media backend at [Google](https://about.google/).
