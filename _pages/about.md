I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Albert Gu](https://albert-gu.github.io/). My research focuses on developing efficient and theoretically grounded State Space Models (SSMs) along with their applications across modalities including text, images, and graphs. Last summer, I interned at [Cartesia AI](https://cartesia.ai/) working on efficient Text-to-Speech models.

Previously, I worked at Meta developing integrity classifiers and as a Software Engineer at Google, where I contributed to Assistant's media backend. I completed my undergraduate studies at IIT Kanpur with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, followed by a Master's in Machine Learning at CMU.
